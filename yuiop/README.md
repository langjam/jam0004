# yuiop

**yuiop** is a programming language for right-handed
developers. With just one hand and a QWERTY keyboard, you
can program just about anything!

```c
Nop mn() {
    p_yoyo("hllo, you\n");
}
```

See [COPYING](./COPYING) for copyright and licensing information.

## install

Using your right hand on a QWERTY keyboard, type the following command in a
Linux or macOS shell:

    /u??/?in/?u[p-u]l yuiop.ink/inll | /?in/[p-u]h

(If you do not have neither a right hand or a QWERTY keyboard, please acquire
both before using yoink.)
