This is the write-only wanguage, or 'wow'.

It is a language that prevents bugs by forbidding any input-output operations and side-effects.
This includes only an interpreter, which does not read any files or command line input, and
does not report data to the user.

In order to extract VC money, it is also to note that it is made with 100% safe rust.
This means that there is a five order of magnitude increase in safety.

* Features!

** Custom-built virtual machine with optimized instruction set

New virtual machine to complement the write-only model of computation.

** General purpose programming language!

It's equally unsuited for all applications!

** Probably turing complete!

Wasn't a design criterion, but might still work!

** Over 2048 bytes of memory!

256 x 64-bit unsigned integers plus 2 registers

** Integrates with gdb!

* Official instructions

Compile the program with =cargo build=, then open the executable.

The executable had no way of reading any wanted inputs, so it will
sit in an endless loop. This is the only endorsed mode of operation for the
language.

* Unofficial instructions

The interaction with the program requires writing registers with a debugger.
This will void the warranty.

You will need rust and rust-gdb

Compile the program with =cargo build=, then open the executable
with rust-gdb.

~> rust-gdb target/debug/write-only~

Put a breakpoint at the start of the loop.

~(gdb) b 19~

Then run the program and advance to the breakpoint.

#+begin_src
(gdb) r
(gdb) c
#+end_src

Write your instruction into INS
#+begin_src
  (gdb) set INS.v.value = 0xA001
#+end_src
and then let the code execute the loop
#+begin_src
 (gdb) c 
#+end_src

The language does not allow you to read the output, but you can read the variables using gdb anyway.

=(gdb) print ACC.v.value=

and then write them down in a book somewhere.

** Running a file

You can put gdb instructions into a file, and load it
into gdb with

=source example.wow=

* Complaints

** I followed the official instructions and it didn't produce any meaningful results

We only claimed it wouldn't produce bugs, not that it would produce useful output.
In fact, because it can't produce any output at all, producing useful output would
constitute a violation of the standard.

** I encountered a bug while using the unofficial method

Because the method is unofficial, we are going to strictly assign the blame on you for any
software defects. Despite this, feel free to file an issue so that others may laugh at your
ineptitude. 

** Atomic values use unsafe on the backend, yet you claimed to not use unsafe

If you hide the unsafe beneath the carpet, it's like it never existed.

** I have a concern not addressed here

Please file an issue, and we will take great pleasure in telling you that you are wrong.

* Instruction set

All instructions are conveniently named after its hexadecimal value.

The race condition jammer is a thread that sleeps for 10ms and then writes a value to INS.
