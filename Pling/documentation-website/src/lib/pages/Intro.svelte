        <h1>Introduction to Pling</h1>

        <h2>Hello, World</h2>

        <p>
            Pling is designed to be used with only one hand by using no modifier keys.
            Keep that in mind as you read through this tutorial.
        </p>

        <p>
            Create a new file ending in <code>.pling</code> and type the following:
        </p>
        <pre>
#print `Hello, World`;</pre>

        <p>
            Save the file and run it with <code>pling</code> or <code>java -jar</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should see the following output:
        </p>
        <pre>Hello, World</pre>

        <p>
            So, let's break down what's going on here.<br/>
            First, we tell the interpreter to run a function using the <code>#</code> symbol.
            You'll see this symbol used a lot in Pling Code.
            Second, we name the function that we want to run, <code>print</code>. This is a built-in function that
            prints the given value to the console. You can find a list of all built-in functions and their
            documentation in the <a href="#/reference">reference</a>. Third, we pass the value that we want to print,
            in this case, <code>`Hello, World`</code>. This is a string literal, which is just some text.
            Lastly, we end the statement with a semicolon, <code>;</code>. This is required at the end of every
            statement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let's try something a little more interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>

        <p>
            Variables are used to store values in Pling. They are declared using the <code>var</code> keyword.
            Let's create a variable called <code>name</code> and set it to <code>`Pling`</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>var name = `Pling`;</pre>

        <p>
            Now, we can use the <code>name</code> variable in our <code>print</code> function.
        </p>
        <pre>
var name = `Pling`;
#print `Hello`, name;</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>Hello, Pling</pre>

        <p>
            Notice that we can pass multiple values to the <code>print</code> function.
            The values are separated by commas. But be careful, if you chain method calls,
            the commas will be assigned to the outermost method call.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can also change the value of a variable.
        </p>
        <pre>
var name = `Pling`;
name = `World`;
#print `Hello`, name;</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>Hello, World</pre>

        <p>
            We can also assign the return value of a function to a variable.
        </p>
        <pre>
var number1 = 1;
var number2 = 2;
var sum = #add number1, number2;
#print sum;</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>3.0</pre>
        <p>
            In Pling, all numbers are stored as doubles, so we get a decimal value.
        </p>

        <p>
            But only running from top to bottom is boring. Let's try adding some logic.
        </p>

        <h2>Control Flow</h2>

        <p>
            Control flow is used to change the flow of execution of a program.
            Pling has two types of control flow: <code>if</code> statements (and related <code>else</code> and
            <code>eif</code>
            statements) and <code>while</code> loops.
        </p>

        <h3>If Statements</h3>

        <p>
            If statements are used to execute code if a condition is met. Something is considered true if it is not an
            empty string or zero. Let's create a variable called <code>number</code> and set it to <code>1</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
var number = 1;</pre>

        <p>
            Now, let's create an <code>if</code> statement that checks if <code>number</code> is equal to <code>1</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
var number = 1;
var isOne = #eq number, 1;
#if isOne [
    #print `number is 1`;
]</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>number is 1</pre>

        <p>
            We can also use the <code>else</code> keyword to execute code if the condition is not met.
            But first, let's change the value of <code>number</code> to <code>2</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
var number = 2;
var isOne = #eq number, 1;
#if isOne [
    #print `number is 1`;
] else [
    #print `number is not 1`;
]</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>number is not 1</pre>

        <p>
            We can also use the <code>eif</code> keyword to check multiple conditions.
        </p>
        <pre>
var number = 2;
var isOne = #eq number, 1;
var isTwo = #eq number, 2;
#if isOne [
    #print `number is 1`;
] eif isTwo [
    #print `number is 2`;
] else [
    #print `number is not 1 or 2`;
]</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>number is 2</pre>

        <h3>While Loops</h3>

        <p>
            While loops are used to execute code while a condition is met.
            Let's create a variable called <code>count</code> and set it to <code>0</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
var count = 0;</pre>

        <p>
            Now, let's create a while loop that increments <code>count</code> until it is equal to <code>10</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
var count = 0;
while #lt count, 10 [
    count = #add count, 1;
]
#print count;</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>10</pre>

        <p>
            In a world with only these tools, we can create some pretty cool things, but it would be nice to have some
            more tools to work with. Let's take a look at functions.
        </p>

        <h2>Functions</h2>

        <p>
            Functions are used to group code together and reuse it. Let's create a function called <code>sum</code>
            that adds two numbers together.
        </p>

        <pre>
func sum #number1, #number2 [
    ret #add number1, number2;
]</pre>

        <p>
            Now, we can call the <code>sum</code> function and pass it two numbers.
        </p>
        <pre>
func sum #number1, #number2 [
    ret #add number1, number2;
]
var result = #sum 1, 2;
#print result;</pre>

        <p>
            The output should be:
        </p>
        <pre>3.0</pre>

        <p>
            A function can also call itself using it's name.
        </p>
